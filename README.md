# IDN Compliant Website Samples

Welcome to the IDN Compliant Website Samples repository! This repository contains sample code and resources for creating Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) compliant websites.

## What is IDN?

Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are domain names that include characters from non-Latin scripts, such as Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, etc. IDNs allow internet users to register domain names in their native languages.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide developers with examples and best practices for building websites that are compliant with IDN standards. By following these samples, developers can ensure that their websites support IDNs correctly and provide a seamless experience for users across different languages and scripts.

## Contents

- **Code Samples:** Explore various code snippets and examples demonstrating how to handle IDNs in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant technologies.
- **Resources:** Find useful links, documentation, and tools for working with IDNs and ensuring compliance with relevant standards.
- **Contributing:** Interested in contributing to this repository? Check out the contribution guidelines to learn how you can get involved.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse the code samples and resources provided in this repository. You can use them as reference material or integrate them directly into your projects. Make sure to follow best practices and standards to ensure IDN compliance in your websites.
